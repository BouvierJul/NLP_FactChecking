labeling imitation dairy products milk or cheese or yogurt 'against the law'?\nBut the FDA in 2008 and 2012 did tell two makers of drinks labeled \"soy milk\" that under its regulations, such labeling was inappropriate because the products did not contain \"milk\" as defined by the agency\nNathan Beaver, a food and drug lawyer with Foley & Lardner in Washington, DC, explained that foods such as soy milk that have no FDA-written \"standard of identity\" must choose a \"common or usual\" name for their products\nDairy alternatives, Baldwin said, \"contain a range of ingredients and nutrients that are often not equivalent to the nutrition content of dairy products\"\nOur own review of labels found that soy and almond beverages, like cow\u2019s milk, are all relatively low calorie, low carbohydrate, low sodium drinks They are all heavy with calcium\nAlmond and soy milks feature some iron and fiber -- nutrients typically not found in cow\u2019s milk\n\"All the products profile differently,\" said Susan Levin, a registered dietitian and director of nutrition education for the Washington, DC-based Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine\nInterview with Susan Levin,

40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs,\" he tweeted on June 21, 2016\nTo analyze Trump\u2019s assertion, we looked at two key questions First, did the trade deficit with China go up by 40 percent during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term -- the period when Clinton was serving as secretary of state?\nLooking instead at the period 2009 through 2013 does produce a 40 percent increase, however, and that\u2019s in line with what Trump said It\u2019s worth noting that this time frame uses 2009 as the baseline year That was the worst point of the recession, which means that the baseline that year was artificially low The strongest support comes from an Economic Policy Institute study that found that between 2001 and 2013, the trade deficit with China \"eliminated or displaced 32 million US jobs,\" of which 24 million were in manufacturing But it\u2019s worth noting that the Economic Policy Institute is a think tank with backing from labor unions, which are often skeptical of free-trade policies\nTrump tweeted, \"Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs\"","1548":"Because

respect for some of the things they do, the cervical cancer on women,\" he said, but they should not receive tax dollars, \"not while they do abortions\"\nSo to recap: Trump\u2019s overarching position on taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood seems to be that he supports defunding Planned Parenthood as long as they continue to perform abortions, even though he respects some of the other work they do for women\u2019s health\nCruz said both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton say Planned Parenthood is \"terrific and that it should keep taxpayer funding\"","1758":"David McKinley correct

supremacists in the table, but other sources such as news accounts or court records showed they held white supremacist or racist views For example, the GAO labeled the murderers of minority victims in an Arizona incident as \"far right violent extremists\" but an Arizona Supreme Court ruling stated that they participated in a militia that focused on \"uplifting\" the white race and fostered negative views of minority groups\nAnother source of data on such attacks is the New America Foundation, which found that about 70 percent of deadly attacks are by people motivated by far right views since Sept 11 However, that includes individuals motivated by views other than white nationalism including more general anti-government views and anti-abortion views\n\"Overall, though the definition

statistics from police departments nationwide Violent crimes include murder and non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault The violent crime rate shows the reported frequency of these crimes per 100,000 people\nA Brennan analysis of declining crime rates over the course of several decades shows the link between mass incarceration and crime reduction is thin Instead analysts

until after the so-called gin epidemic had ended in the early 1750s, and its conclusion wasn\u2019t due to beer\nThe gin epidemic\u2019s end eventually came at the hand of multiple factors, including the rising price of grain, reduced wages and legislation that raised taxes on gin Beer consumption also remained stagnant during the 18th century, which experts say suggests people were drinking gin, or cheap spirits generally, in addition to beer, not substituting one for the other\nThe trends in consumption don\u2019t suggest it While the consumption of spirits increased, beer drinking during

consulate or embassy,\" said Stephen H Legomsky, an emeritus professor at the Washington University School of Law in St Louis who served as chief counsel of US Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013\nGoing to a US embassy or consulate does not count as being physically present in the United States for purposes of the asylum statute, said Deborah Anker, a clinical professor of law, founder and director of the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program at Harvard Law School\nTodd Winer, a spokesman for Labrador, said there\u2019s already a legal process in place for those seeking asylum, \"so there is no excuse for anyone trying to cross the border illegally\" (According to US law, immigrants can apply for asylum even if they enter the country illegally)S They can also submit their application online when in the US,\" Winer said \"The Democrats\u2019 charge that people need to illegally cross the border to gain asylum is what really needs to be fact-checked\"","1364":"\"Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of

screen\"\nIf the UNHCR refers refugees to the United States, they then face scrutiny from federal intelligence and security agencies\nThe process typically takes one to two years or longer and happens before a refuge ever steps onto American soil Ultimately, says the State Department, about half are approved, and there\u2019s no real precedent of a terrorist slipping in through the vetting system\nThere\u2019s no question that there are challenges to screening refugees from conflict zones like Syria Intelligence and national security officials have noted the paucity of data\nTrump said there is \"no system to vet\" refugees from the Middle East\nWhile there are concerns about information gaps, a system does exist and has existed since 1980 It involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies as well as the United Nations Refugee vetting typically takes one to two years and includes numerous rounds of security checks","3191":"\"So right now, America's tax code is a total dysfunctional mess,\" Trump said in a speech in St Charles, Mo, on Nov 29, 2017 \"The current system has cost our nation millions of American jobs, trillions and trillions of dollars, and billions of hours wasted on paperwork and compliance It is riddled with loopholes that let some special interests -- including myself, in all fairness This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing -- believe me Believe me, this is not good for me The analyses of the bills we have seen show advantages, not disadvantages, for the wealthy as well as corporations\nWhen we asked the White House for additional details about how the law would hurt Trump, they cited the repeal of the state and local tax deduction, which allows taxpayers to deduct all or some of their state and local tax burden from their federal taxable income As a wealthy resident of New York City, Trump would likely face high tax state and local rates (At the Nov 30 press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee

governs traditional public schools, requires teachers to \"hold the certificate required by law and by rules of the State Board of Education\" in order to teach\nHowever, certification is not mandatory for a subset of Florida charter schools, called the \"schools of hope\" These charter schools operate within underserved districts that have \"persistently low-performing schools\" The legislature hoped to attract successful charter organizations from other states by offering financial incentives and increased administrative freedom Gov Rick Scott signed the controversial bill,
